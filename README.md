*Hi every body, I am Gilbert Ardila*


I am a jr web developer and enjoy developing new projects!!  


I live in Bogotá-Colombia, I have worked in personal projects as a Knowledge selft growing and I invite you to peck my GitHub account  


Right now I am working in Html/Css and JavaScript in front-end, but also in Java/Springboot in back-end and data bases like MySql and MongoDB, but I am also learning new things every week, right now I am in a React course and, offcourse, the web development school in Platzi.


My projects:


*-Movies+*


it is a web site were you can see the movies billboard and also create a favourites movies list
it was made in html/css/javascript consuming a public API called themoviedb
this is a single page application SPA, we use location.hash to create the ilussion ofchanging pages, we also use localStorage to save the favourites movies list

*-Proyecto SENA*


this is a proyect for the SENA academy in Colombia, this is a decoupled project(frontend/backend)
first part is backend: made in Java and SpringBoot is connected to a SQL data base, here we use the abstraction concept, we have layers to save the data integrity.
as a dependencys in this project we use  Loombok, spring-data jpa, thymeleaf, spring web, spring dev tools, MySQL conector.
as a second part we have the frontend: it was made in html/css and javascript only. also we consume the Jquery and uuid libraries.

*-Alura-Geek*


this is a virtual store, but focuses in the administrator user; customer can see the products, filter them by name, see the diferentent categories and echa product by it self, but there is not a purchase method implemented; administrator can handle a CRUD in all the produts, can change pictures too.
